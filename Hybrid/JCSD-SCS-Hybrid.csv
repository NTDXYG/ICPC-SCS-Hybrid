"returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base-level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base-level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side-effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n 's next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b 's current successor , which means that we do n't have a consistent 3-node snapshot and so can not unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n 's value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking does n't require restart , they are n't sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n 's predecessor 's value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we ca n't unlink the node because we do n't know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b.value check is n't strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they ca n't easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed ."

"causes current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the method or the method for this object , or a specified amount of time has elapsed . the current thread must own this object 's monitor . this method causes the current thread ( call it t ) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object . thread t becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens : some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread t happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened . some other thread invokes the notifyall method for this object . some other thread interrupts thread t. the specified amount of real time has elapsed , more or less . if timeout is zero , however , then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified . the thread t is then removed from the wait set for this object and re-enabled for thread scheduling . it then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object ; once it has gained control of the object , all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is , to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked . thread t then returns from the invocation of the wait method . thus , on return from the wait method , the synchronization state of the object and of thread t is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked . if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting , then an interruptedexception is thrown . this exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above . note that the wait method , as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object , unlocks only this object ; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits . this method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object 's monitor . see the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor ."
